aSsearchAway is a movie search app I built to showcase my skills in creating web applications. It's designed to help users search and filter through a massive library of movies, all with a clean, simple and responsive UI.

Features:

- Real-Time Search: Powered by Meilisearch, results update dynamically as you type.
- Genre Filtering: Narrow down your search by selecting genres (dinamically created, as well).
- Sorting by Year: Latest-Older. Sort movies by their release year.
- Quick Previews: Hover over a movie to get a peek of its overview.
  (pending: pagination)

Tools:

- Front-end: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.
- Search Engine: Meilisearch, providing fast and accurate search results.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Integrate third-party APIs and services (like Meilisearch).
- Build responsive and interactive web applications.
